      marries King Roland of Enchancia. Sofia becomes a princess, moves into a

      to other princesses who can help her. The story follows Sofia as she
      learns the true meaning of being a princess through adventures that test
      her kindness and heart, while the sorcerer Cedric repeatedly tries to
